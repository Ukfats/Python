My first attempt at a re-write in Python, the original file is a bash script.

Attempted to use Python modules to handle the keyboard and mouse actions (mouse, keyboard, pynput.mouse, pynput.keyboard).
Never managed to get them working, Python calls them as shell(sh) commands which aren't recognised while using os.system 
and subprocess.Popen.

As a workaround I put the Linux 'xdotool' commands in lists and called those.
