The plan is to create a basic functionality analog to the program "Voice Attack" for gaming...budget voice attack aka "bva".
Taking input from the mic and performing a corresponding action via. keystrokes/mouse buttons.

Example: In a flight sim style game, saying "landing gear" would perform the keyboard shortcut for toggling the landing gear of an aircraft.

As I'm only 3 days into learning Python as of writing this, I need to break down the elements to figure out how things are working/will eventually 
work.

Done:
# dictaphone.py - takes mic input and saves it to a list.
# doppleganger.py - takes an input phrase and compares it to a list of commands stored in a dictionary and runs the command associated with the phrase.
# bva.py - joined dictaphone and doppleganger functions, not takes mic input > converts audio to string > finds dictionary value for the string and 
runs that as an xdotool keyboard command.

To Do:
*Figure out how to keep the Wingman program running in the background until a keypress toggles a listen mode to start the "dictaphone" stage.

*Add error handling for voice input so it doesn't crash out if a voice cannot be heard or transcribed.

Ideally the program will keep running after performing its action, but not against letting the program restart itself after each use as the list 
only needs to hold a single entry to compare at a time...depends on how long it takes to be ready again.

Probably missing some steps but I don't know what I don't know yet.
